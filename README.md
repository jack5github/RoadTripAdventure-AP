# Road Trip Adventure Archipelago
This is an Archipelago randomizer implementation for the PlayStation 2 game Road Trip Adventure.

Archipelago is a multi-game randomizer that can shuffle items from one game into another. It can also be played solo like a standard randomizer. For more info, check out their website: https://archipelago.gg/

## Randomizer Details
### Goal
- Win the race against against President Forest (Stamp 100)

### Area Unlock Modes: Decorations, or Stamps
- In Road Trip AP, you must unlock a city before you are allowed to interact with it in any way. This means you cannot enter any buildings, talk to anyone, or collect overworld items in a town until you unlock it. Peach Town and My City are unlocked by default.
- There are two YAML settings for what is required to unlock a town: **Decorations**, or **Stamps**.
- In Decorations mode, the garage decorations serve as area unlock keys. Each town has two decorations that serve as their key - obtaining either unlocks the town.
- In Stamps mode, your stamps become items in the multiworld, and you unlock the next town in linear sequence with every 5 stamps obtained.

| City | Decoration Unlock | Stamp Unlock |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Peach Town | (Free) | (Free) |
| Fuji City | Gold Ornament / Policeman's Club | 5 stamps |
| My City | (Free) | (Free) |
| Sandpolis | Mini-Tower / Toy Gun | 10 stamps |
| Chestnut Canyon | Model Train / M. Carton's Painting | 15 stamps |
| Mushroom Road | Flower Pattern / Sky Pattern | 20 stamps |
| White Mountain | Christmas Tree / Arctic Pattern | 25 stamps |
| Papaya Island | Papaya Ukulele / UnbaboDoll | 30 stamps |
| Cloud Hill | God's Rod / Angel's Wings | 35 stamps |

## Frequently Asked Questions
- What versions of the game are supported?
    - Currently, only NTSC-U.
- Are there plans to support PAL and/or NTSC-J?
    - Maybe, TBD. If I do, it will likely be a while until they are supported.
    - Uncertain on NTSC-J support in particular, as it likely differs more from NTSC-U internally than PAL.
- Are there plans to add Q coins and Quick-Pic shops as items/locations?
    - Yes! It's one of the higher-priority things on my list.
