"""
Archipelago randomizer implementation for the PS2 game Road Trip.
(Named "Road Trip Adventure" in PAL, "ChoroQ HG2" in NTSC-J, and sometimes referred to as 
"Everywhere Road Trip" in NTSC-U.)


AP GENERATION PROCESS OVERVIEW (aka "What are all these classes for, and how are they used?")
During the multiworld generation process, AP searches for any files with the .apworld extension in
its "custom_worlds" directory, and attempts to import the contents of each as a Python module.

This file (__init__.py) is the first thing imported. When imported, it will make AP aware of
all of its classes, functions, etc.

Later, after finding all valid .apworld files (and core worlds in the "worlds" directory) that
match the player-provided YAML settings files, AP will create an instance of each of those world's  
World class (for Road Trip, this is RoadTripWorld), and attempt to call a series of methods from all of them.

For example, one of the first methods called is "generate_early". All world instances will have their 
"generate_early" methods called, if they have that method.

Then, AP will attempt to call the next of these methods, "create_regions", from all world instances. 
All of these are run back-to-back. This continues for the remainder of the generation methods.

List of methods available:
https://alwaysintreble.github.io/Archipelago/world%20api.html#generation

This sums up the World side of an AP world (i.e. the portion that runs during generation).
The client is separate, and is the program the user runs from the AP launcher to play the game.
See __init__.py in the client folder for more info.


NOTE: .apworld files are just zip folders with a specific directory structure, see 
https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/apworld%20specification.md#apworld-file-format
