"""
Archipelago client for Road Trip Adventure
This is what the player runs from the Archipelago launcher in order to have AP and the game interact with each other.

Like most retro console games, this inherits from AP's CommonClient classes (which handle a lot of functionality for
us, see comments in RTAContext below) and interacts with an emulator (in this case PCSX2, via an API called PINE).

When AP finishes generating a multiworld, it stores any data saved to the 'slot_data' dictionary as part of our
slot on the server (typically done in the world's 'fill_slot_data' function).

Then, when we connect to that slot on the server using our client, it needs to request and store that slot_data.
This is how we pass any necessary information from the generation process to the client (for example, what the
shop purchases have been randomized to, so we can display the new item names in Road Trip).

Before handling items and locations, we first verify that the game either already has the RTA AP patches applied, 
or is in the main menu so they can be applied (since it's a safe place to do so), and then confirm we've connected 
to the correct slot (by comparing its slot_data's save ID to the one stored in our RTA save file).

Once verified, we start handling items and locations.

For items, CommonClient manages a received_items list for us. All we have to do is regularly check it, keep track
of how many of those items we've already handled, and update the game accordingly.

Lastly, for locations, we need to send the server various commands when we complete location checks in game (using
CommonClient's 'send_msgs' function) so it can send out the corresponding item for that location.
