"""
Contains the locations in RAM of everything we need to manage the game.

For tables and data structures, we store the starting location of the data, and the size of the data.

We also store the base IDs from the generation process. For all items and locations, the AP IDs match
the in-game IDs, just with a base value added depending on the type of item/location. 
All we need to do to figure out what item/location we're dealing with is to subtract the correct base ID
from the ID we pull from the game.
